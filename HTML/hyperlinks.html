    We're talking away
    I'm to say I'll say it anyway
    Today's another day to find you
    Shying away
    I'll be coming for your love, ok?
    
    Take on me
    Take me on
    I'll be gone
    In a day or two
    
    So needless to say
    I'm odds and ends
    But I'll be stumbling away
    Slowly learning that life is ok
    Say after me
    It's no better to be safe than sorry
    
    Take on me
    Take me on
    I'll be gone
    In a day or two
    
    Oh the things that you say
    Is it live or
    Just to play my worries away
    You're all the things I've got to remember
    You're shying away
    I'll be coming for you anyway
    
    Take on me
    Take me on
    I'll be gone
    In a day or two
    I don't know what
